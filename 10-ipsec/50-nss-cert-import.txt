1. POSSIBILITY TO IMPORT CERTIFICATES AT RUNTIME

This was addressed in 3.14 when we moved from the NSS db to the sql
format. You are able to import the certificate on a running system.

2. NSS & X.509 CERTIFICATES

https://libreswan.org/wiki/3.14_X509

Database changes

Pluto uses an SQL format NSS database, by default in /etc/ipsec.d. This format allows pluto to pick up changes to the database without requiring a restart. When upgrading libreswan to 3.14, the 'ipsec checknss' command run on service startup will attempt to upgrade the existing DBM format database.

    ipsec checknss first detects if an upgrade is needed and runs a certutil --upgrade-merge on the database. If /etc/ipsec.d/nsspassword is present it will also preserve the database password from that file.
    Any certificates and crls in /etc/ipsec.d/cacerts and /etc/ipsec.d/crls will be imported into the upgraded database. If these are duplicate, or old, it won't replace anything current in the database.

When using crlutil or certutil on the upgraded database, you must always prefix the database path with 'sql:'. For example, to list all certificates:

certutil -L -d sql:/etc/ipsec.d

Running certutil commands without the sql: prefix looks in the directory for different database files that are not read by pluto, so don't get mixed up! Alternately, you can set the NSS_DEFAULT_DB_TYPE environment variable to 'sql:' and use certutil/crlutil as normal.

3. CERTIFICATE IMPORT

1) Can we import a "user certificate" (i.e. with a private key) directly?
2) Can we import a signing (CA) certificate directly? - YES.
   Can we generate our own local user certificate and sign it with a CA cert?
